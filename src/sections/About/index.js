          I started coding back in 2018, my first programming language was{' '}
          <strong>python</strong>. I was motivated to learn programming because
          I had programming lessons at university and I quickly fallen in love
          with it. After some time I switched to <strong>javascript</strong>{' '}
          because I wanted to jump deep into <strong>web development</strong>. I
          still use python, mainly to automate boring office related work via
          selenium.

          My biggest goal at the moment is to find my first webdev related job
          so I can become a professional developer and do what I love for the
          living. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll fit perfectly in your company.
